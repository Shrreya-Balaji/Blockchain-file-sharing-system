# Decentralized File Sharing System with Blockchain Integration

## Project Overview
This project implements a decentralized file-sharing system using blockchain technology to ensure security and user control. Users can securely upload, manage, and share files while leveraging AES encryption for data privacy. Ethereum smart contracts facilitate transparent and secure file access management. The system also includes comprehensive activity logging to track user actions and file interactions for accountability.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Storage:** AWS S3
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum smart contracts (solidity programming language)

## Modules
1. **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration.
2. **File Management:** Upload, download, and manage files securely with AES encryption.
3. **File Sharing:** Utilize Ethereum smart contracts for transparent and secure file sharing.
4. **Activity Logging:** Track user actions and file activities for accountability and transparency.
